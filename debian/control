Description: JRL matrix abstract layer
 OpenRTM-aist is one of the reference implementations of RT-Middleware
 that AIST has been implementing and distributing. It consists of
 RT-Component framework to create RT-Components, RT-Middleware that
 manages the lifecycle of RT-Component, moreover RtcTemplate to
 generate skeleton codes of the components and GUI tools to operate
 and connect RT-Components. Currently, AIST provides reference
 implementations for C++, Python and Java, and develops other versions
 of implementing other languages. There are compatibility middleware
 of OpenRTM for Java and .NET as reference implementation of
 Version 0.2.0 compatibility.
